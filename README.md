# Inventory Hub App using Java on Azure #

The purpose of this sample application is to illustrate building responsive systems with serverless, event-driven Java on Azure; the result of this project will be to create a real-time inventory hub.

## Requirements ##

In order to create and deploy this sample application, you need to have the following:

An Azure subscription; if you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can activate your [MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/) or sign up for a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

In addition, you will need all of the following components before you go through the steps in this README:

| [Azure CLI](http://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/overview) | [Java 8](http://java.oracle.com/) | [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/) | [Git](https://github.com/) |

**NOTE**: There are additional requirements in the *[~/deployment/README.md](deployment/README.md)* file which are required in order to setup your development environment; other required components will be installed automatically by the provisioning scripts.

## Overview ##

In the following sections, you will create a development sandbox environment on Azure which uses the following components:

- Two [Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs/) in one Event Hub Namespace per region
    - an event hub receives events from Point of Sale (POS) and Point of Intake (POI) units
    - an event hub receives events to notify any app that listens for inventory change
- One [Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/) configured for "read/write" in the first region and "read" for additional regions
- Set of [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) apps per region
    - One Point of Sale (POS) function app to simulate a terminal in a store, one per terminal
    - One Point of Intake (POI) function app to simulate a terminal in a warehouse, one per terminal
    - One Update Inventory function app triggered by events produced by POS and POI units to update inventory 
    - One Notify function app triggered by updates to inventory
- One [Azure Web App](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/) per region or One [Pivotal Cloud Foundry instance on Azure](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/pivotal.pivotal-cloud-foundry) per region

The following diagram illustrates the full topology for this sample application environment:

## Create and Deploy the Inventory Hub ##

<a name="create-the-initial-build"></a>
### Create the initial build ###

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the *~/deployment/* folder of your local repo.

```shell
   cd deployment
   ```

1. Login to your Azure account and specify which subscription to use:

   ```shell
   az login
   az account set --subscription "<your-azure-subscription>"
   ```

   **NOTE**: You can use either a subscription name or id when specifying which subscription to use; to obtain a list of your subscriptions, type `az account list`.

1. Set a unique prefix for creating an initial layout on Azure.

   ```shell
   export INVENTORY_HUB_APP_NAME="<your-unique-prefix>"
   ```

2. Follow the deployment [README](./deployment) instructions to create Azure resources.


### Deploy Inventory Processor

1. Deploy Update Product Inventory function app as described in the [README](./function-apps/Update-Product-Inventory)
2. Deploy Append Transactions function app as described in the [README](./function-apps/Append-Transaction)

### Deploy Inventory Dashboard Web App

1. Deploy Inventory Dashboard Web app as described in [README](./dashboard-web-app)

### Deploy POI and POS Terminals as Azure Function Apps

1. Deploy Point of Inventory terminal as function app as described in [README](./function-apps/Point-Of-Transaction). Deploy one per terminal. If you were to imagine 4 terminals then you would deploy 4 similar function apps
2. Deploy Point of Sale terminal as function app as described in [README](./function-apps/Point-Of-Transaction). Deploy one per terminal. If you were to imagine 4 terminals then you would deploy 4 similar function apps

### Open the Inventory Hub Web App
